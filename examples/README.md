# Example Test Data

This directory can contain sample medieval manuscript images for testing the application.

## Sample Images

You can use the following sources for test images:

1. **Digital Bodleian** - https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/
   - Search for "medieval manuscripts" or "neumes"
   - Download high-resolution images

2. **Gallica (BnF)** - https://gallica.bnf.fr/
   - Search for "manuscrits latins" or "notation musicale"
   - Public domain medieval manuscripts

3. **Internet Archive** - https://archive.org/
   - Search for "medieval manuscripts music"
   - Many manuscripts available for download

4. **Cantus Database** - https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/
   - Specialized in Gregorian chant manuscripts
   - Images and metadata

## Recommended Test Cases

1. **Simple neume notation** - Single punctum or virga marks
2. **Complex ligatures** - Multiple connected notes (pes, clivis, scandicus)
3. **Text with notation** - Latin text with neumes above
4. **Full page** - Complete manuscript page with multiple lines

## Tips for Test Images

- Use clear, high-resolution images (300 DPI or higher)
- Ensure good lighting/contrast in the scan
- Try both black-and-white and color manuscripts
- Test with different manuscript styles (square notation, Gothic, etc.)

## Voice Test Phrases

When testing the voice transcription, try these Latin phrases:

- "punctum" - single note
- "virga" - vertical note
- "pes" - ascending two-note neume
- "clivis" - descending two-note neume
- "scandicus" - three ascending notes
- "climacus" - three descending notes
- "torculus" - three-note turn
- "porrectus" - three-note extended
- "quilisma" - wavy line ornament
- "liquescent" - melting note
- "graduale" - mass proper chant
- "antiphonale" - office chant book
- "responsoria" - responsorial chants

## Example Workflow

1. Upload a manuscript page with clear neume notation
2. Mark a simple punctum while saying "punctum"
3. Mark a pes while saying "pes - two ascending notes"
4. Mark a clivis while saying "clivis - two descending notes"
5. Review transcriptions and verify accuracy

Place your test images in this directory (they will be ignored by git).
